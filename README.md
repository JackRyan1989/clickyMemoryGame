# clickyMemoryGame
React based memory game!

Keep clicking the Ren & Stimpy pics until you can't remember what you clicked. 

The app will keep track of your score as you go, and will alert you when you click the same image twice (and lose!). 

You can then try to beat your high score! The highest score you can get is 15, since that's the number of available images.

Try to get 15!

Built in ReactJS and React Bootstrap using a bit of CSS styling.
